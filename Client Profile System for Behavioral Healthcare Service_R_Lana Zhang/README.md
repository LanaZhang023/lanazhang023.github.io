In behavioral healthcare services, effective client engagement is critical to ensuring timely access to care and maximizing treatment outcomes. However, resource limitations often make it challenging to allocate outreach efforts equitably and efficiently. This project aims to develop a data-driven client prioritization framework to assist behavioral health agencies in identifying which clients might need more emotional support, who is more likely to respond quickly, and where to allocate resources efficiently. 

We conducted a series of statistical and machine learning analyses—including logistic regression, random forest, and survival analysis—to uncover key predictors of successful healthcare service enrollment. We further constructed a weighted scoring system based on odds ratios and variable importance, and visualized client profiles via interactive radar maps, allowing agencies and providers to stratify outreach targets and optimize staff allocation, ultimately improving equity and efficiency in the healthcare services delivery.
