Cleaned, validated, and visualized over 10,000 linical trial patient records from EDC system in SAS. I developed a robust SAS pipeline to standardize key variables (e.g., Sex, ARMCD, BMI, AvgCost), perform data deduplication, and generate summary tables using a custom macro %tablen. I also implemented stratified visualizations using PROC TTEST and PROC SGPLOT, including customized box plots to clearly differentiate male and female groups. A major challenge was the need to assign distinct marker symbols by sex group; I overcame the default limitations of MEANATTRS and OUTLIERATTRS by experimenting with over 100 trials and finally applying attribute maps to enable symbol-level differentiationâ€”ensuring clarity in stakeholder-facing reports.
