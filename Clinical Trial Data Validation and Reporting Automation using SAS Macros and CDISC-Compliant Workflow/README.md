# üß™ Clinical Trial Data Validationa and Reporting Automation using SAS Macros and CDISC-Compliant Workflow

A CDISC-compliant SAS workflow for clinical trial data preprocessing, statistical reporting, and automated visualization.

---

## üìã Project Summary

This project simulates a **Phase II clinical trial** with over **11,000 patient records**, automating the full pipeline from raw Electronic Data Capture (EDC) data to a polished **regulatory-grade PDF report** using **SAS macro programming**. The workflow strictly adheres to **CDISC SDTM/ADaM** standards and replicates real-world data cleaning, safety analysis, and baseline comparability assessments in clinical trials.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

### üìä Macros Development

This project features two key reusable SAS macros designed to streamline clinical trial data standardization and baseline reporting in compliance with CDISC practices:

1.`%standardization_macro`: cleans and derives analysis-ready variables
 * **Sex** normalization (e.g., 'fem' ‚Üí 'F')
 * **Treatment arm** recoding ('DRUG A' ‚Üí 'Drug A')
 * **Age** from birthdate and enrollment date
 * **BMI** and **BMI categories** (Underweight, Normal, etc.)
 * **Average Cost** calculations (mean of 3 cost fields, rounded)
 * Imputes **missing Study_end_Date** to trial cutoff (01OCT2024)
 * Replaces **missing values** with 'NA', standardizes label
 * Keeps only **CWIDs** containing 'yiz4018' for simulated inclusion criteria

2. `%tablen` macro: auto-generate formatted baseline comparison tables

 * **Kruskal-Wallis** and **Chi-square** tests for group difference
 * **P-value annotations** with descriptive footnotes
 * Supports both **continuous** and **categorical** variables
 * Built-in **total column** and **footnotes** for clinical readability

### üîß Data Cleaning & Standardization

* Standardized clinical trial variables using `%standardization_macro`
* Removed **duplicate records** and handled **missing values** using `PROC SORT`

### üì¶ CDISC-Compliant Dataset Construction

All datasets followed **CDISC variable naming conventions** and metadata standards

* Built **SDTM DM domain** for demographic metadata
* Created **ADaM ADSL** dataset by merging treatment, demographic, and derived variables
* Constructed **ADaM ADAE** dataset with simulated AE terms (e.g., *Headache*, *Nausea*) and treatment mapping

### üìà Data Visualizations

* Created Baseline Characteristics Table by Treatment Group using `%tablen` macro
* Generated Adverse Events Summary by Treatment Group using `PROC FREQ`
* Used `PROC TTEST` to produce summary panels and Q‚ÄìQ plots for **Age distribution** by treatment group
* Created grouped **boxplots for BMI** (stratified by **Sex √ó Treatment**) via `PROC SGPLOT`
* Applied `STYLEATTRS` and `ATTRIBUTE MAPS` to control marker display and improve interpretability

### üìã Automated Report Generation

* Generated fully formatted **PDF report** using `ODS PDF` and `PROC ODSTEXT`
* Report includes:
  * **Executive summary**, study metadata, and CDISC context
  * Descriptive captions for all tables and figures
  * Automated statistical interpretations with clinical insight
* Mimics **CRO deliverables** used in sponsor-facing documentation
