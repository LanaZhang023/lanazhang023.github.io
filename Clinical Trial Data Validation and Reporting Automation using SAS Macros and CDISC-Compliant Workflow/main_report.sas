Report Date   : July 25, 2025

Department    : Biostatistics and Data Science, Weill Cornell Graduate School

Background
----------
This report documents a simulated Phase II randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to assess 
baseline demographic comparability and adverse event distribution between Drug B and Placebo groups. 
The analysis adheres to CDISC (Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium) standards, including 
the SDTM (Study Data Tabulation Model) and ADaM (Analysis Data Model) structures.

Objective
---------
The primary objective is to validate randomization balance and evaluate potential safety signals. 
The study focuses on:
 - Standardizing raw patient data;
 - Building regulatory-compliant SDTM and ADaM datasets;
 - Performing exploratory statistical summaries and visualizations.

Data Source
-----------
The patient-level dataset was simulated and imported from the Excel file: 'patients_raw_data.xlsx'  
It includes de-identified subject-level records with information on:
 - Demographics (sex, age, BMI)
 - Treatment assignment (ARMCD)
 - Enrollment & end dates
 - Safety outcomes (lab data, adverse events)
 - Derived variables (e.g., cost, BMI categories)

Programming Standards
---------------------
All data cleaning, derivation, and reporting follow:
 - CDISC SDTM/ADaM standards;
 - FDA submission readiness principles;
 - SAS 9.4 programming environment;
 - Best practices in clinical programming and exploratory analysis.

Report Components
-----------------
This report includes three major analytical components:

1. **Raw Data Cleaning and Variable Derivation** 
 
1.1 **Standardization of Key Variables**
    - Recoding and formatting of SEX and ARMCD variables.
    - Calculation of derived variables such as BMI and Average Cost.
    - Age computed based on birth date and reference date.
    
1.2 **Data Quality Assurance**
    - Identification and removal of duplicate patient records.
    - Imputation flags and documentation of missing values.
    
2. **CDISC-Compliant Dataset Construction**

2.1 **SDTM DM Domain (Demographics)**
    - Extraction and transformation of subject-level demographic data.
    - Mapping of source variables to CDISC SDTM-compliant DM structure.

2.2 **ADaM ADSL Domain (Subject-Level Analysis Dataset)**
    - Merging of demographic, treatment, and derived variables.
    - Creation of analysis-ready ADSL dataset with required ADaM metadata.
    
2.3 **ADaM ADAE Domain (Adverse Events Analysis Dataset)**
    - Simulated construction of the ADAE domain to support adverse event analysis.
    - AE terms were programmatically assigned in an alternating pattern between "Headache" and "Nausea" to create a mock dataset.
    - Treatment group variable (`TRT01P`) was mapped from the original treatment code (`ARMCD`) for each subject.

3. **Exploratory Safety Summary and Data Visualization**

3.1 **Table1: Patient Snapshot After Preprocessing**
    - Displays the first 100 cleaned patient records.
    - Validates deduplication, variable standardization, and structural readiness.

3.2 **Table2: Baseline Characteristics Comparison**
    - Summary statistics of key demographic and clinical variables.
    - Between-group comparison using nonparametric and categorical tests.
    - P-values from Kruskal-Wallis and Chi-Square tests included.

3.3 **Table3: Adverse Event Frequency Summary**
    - Counts and proportions of major adverse events (Headache, Nausea).
    - Chi-Square and Fisherâ€™s Exact tests for treatment group comparisons.

3.4 **Figure 1: Age Distribution by Treatment Group**
    - Histogram and Q-Q plots from PROC TTEST to evaluate distributional differences.
    - Assess symmetry and comparability of age distributions.

3.5 **Figure 2: BMI Distribution by Sex and Treatment Group**
    - Stratified boxplots visualizing BMI patterns across treatment arms and sex.
    - Highlights potential outliers and evaluates baseline BMI balance.

Key Results Summary
-------------------
 - A total of **11,878 patients** were analyzed after preprocessing.
 - **Baseline demographics** (age, BMI, cost) were well-balanced across treatment groups.
 - **Adverse events** (Headache and Nausea) showed no statistically significant difference between Drug B and Placebo (P > 0.70).
 - Visualizations further confirmed demographic and safety comparability.

Conclusion
----------
The study confirms successful baseline balance through randomization and suggests no initial safety concerns 
between Drug B and Placebo arms based on reported adverse events. The analytical pipeline demonstrates 
standard-compliant, auditable clinical data processing.

A total of 11,878 patients were included in the analysis. Age was approximately balanced across groups, with a mean of 41.2 years in the Drug B group and 41.7 years in the Placebo group. The Kruskal-Wallis test showed no statistically significant difference in age (P=0.2732). BMI was also similar among groups, with a mean of 21.3 kg/mÂ² across both Drug B and Placebo. No significant difference was observed (P=0.6165). In terms of BMI categories (cWeight), nearly half of the participants fell into the 'Normal weight' group across all arms (49.1%), and about 28% were classified as 'Underweight'. The proportion of 'Obese' and 'Morbidly Obese' subjects was low (<5%). Chi-square testing indicated no significant group difference (P=0.8479). The average cost variable was normally distributed with similar means across groups: 64.4 in Drug B and 64.3 in Placebo. There was no significant difference (P=0.5427). Overall, the randomization process appears to have achieved baseline balance across treatment groups, supporting the validity of downstream comparative analyses." / style=[font_size=10pt];

Nausea occurred in 49.88% and 50.12% of participants in the respective groups. AE frequencies were nearly identical between groups. The Chi-square test yielded a non-significant result (Ï‡Â²=0.1343, df=1, P=0.7140), indicating no statistically significant difference in adverse event distribution between treatment groups. Other tests, including the likelihood ratio and Fisherâ€™s exact test, corroborated this conclusion (two-sided P=0.7273).
