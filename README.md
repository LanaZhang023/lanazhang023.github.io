Projects:  

**Client Profile System for Behavioral Healthcare Service - R + ShinyApp**  
[RadarMapShinyApp](https://lanazhang023.shinyapps.io/client_profile_radar_map/)  
Developed a client profile system covering across 12 key behavioral dimensions to optimize healthcare services outreach, performing multiple imputation for data wrangling, applying logistic regression and random forestst for weighted score system, and using Cross-validation and A/B Testing for Model Validation, which reduced average follow-up attempts from 6.77 to 4.45 and increased outreach success rates by at least 30%. Final interactive radar maps was built using ShinyApp, allowing users to select individual clients and view personalized priority levels and recommended outreach strategies.

**Clinical Trial Data Validation and Reporting Automation using SAS Macros and CDISC-Compliant Workflow - SAS**  
[ClinicalTrialReportSummary.pdf](Clinical%20Trial%20Data%20Validation%20and%20Reporting%20Automation%20using%20SAS%20Macros%20and%20CDISC-Compliant%20Workflow/clinical_study_report.pdf)  
Simulated a Phase II clinical trial with 11,000+ patients records from Electronic Data Capture (EDC) System using CDISC-compliant pipeline, building SDTM and ADaM datasets, applying macro-based summary tables (%tablen), and generating stratified visualizations (PROC TTEST & SGPLOT). Final report automated as a publication-ready PDF with narrative interpretation of baseline comparability and adverse event profiles, supporting downstream clinical decision-making.

**DrugExTrack: Gender-Specific Drug Ingredient Exposure Analysis - SQL + R**  
Analyzed gender differences in drug ingredient exposure using CMS synthetic patient data standardized under OMOP CDM v5.2. Applied advanced SQL window functions to extract per-patient drug usage statistics and conducted hypothesis testing in R via one-tailed t-test to evaluate statistical significance of gender disparities in medication exposure. Confirmed that female patients were significantly more likely to be exposed to multiple drug ingredients than males.
